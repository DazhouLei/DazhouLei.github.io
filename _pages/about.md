## Personal Interests & Musings

At heart, I'm driven by a deep curiosity about uncovering the 'why' behind things and the hidden patterns that connect them. This fascination isn't limited to academic models; it's the same spark I feel when exploring historical events. I'm captivated by the challenge of modeling these complex systems – sifting through details, identifying key mechanisms – aiming to be both an **explorer**, mapping uncharted territories of data, and a **forecaster**, glimpsing potential futures illuminated by the patterns we discover.

When unplugged from the data streams, I recharge by diving into books (history remains a steadfast favorite!), exploring narratives in film and music, and occasionally attempting my own writing.
